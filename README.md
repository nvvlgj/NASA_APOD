# NASA_APOD

Requirements: 
- Allow users to search for the picture for a date of their choice
- Allow users to create/manage a list of &quot;favorite&quot; listings
- Display date, explanation, Title and the image / video of the day
- App should cache information and should display last updated information in case of
network unavailability.

Implementation:
- This project allows user to search for the picture of the day for a date of their choice
- On initial load, today's picture of the day is loaded.
- The image, title, description and date are visible in the first screen and all of the elemnts are added in a stack view which is added to a scroll view inside the view controller.
- The first screen also has two buttons - "Add to favourites" and "Favourites".
- Currently, the "Favourites" button launches a collection view with a certain start date and end date.
- The "Add to favourites" button currently does not have any action attached to it and implementation of the collection view controller to display favourites is pending.
